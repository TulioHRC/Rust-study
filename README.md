# Rust-study

I have to be honest, the reason I'm studying this language is for money. I saw some videos talking about how well paid Rust developers receive, and I got interested.

All I know is: Rust is a low-level language, like C++, with some different aspects.

### Characteristcs

Programming language developed by Mozilla.

#### Typed Language
- Statically typed -> all types are set in compiling time
- Strongly typed -> you're not allowed to use one type as another type

#### Compatibility
- .exe compatibility (binary compilation)

#### Code Safety
When comparing to C++, Rust has a much better coe safety.
- Prevents null pointers
- Prevents also memory leaks
In compile time.
